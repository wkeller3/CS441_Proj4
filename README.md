When the app starts you are brought to the main menu. You can choose to either play the game or check the leaderboard. In the beginning the leaderboard has no scores, but as you play it will show the top 3 scores. The leaderboard is scrollable. To play the game you can jump by tapping the top half of the screen, go left by holding the left side of the screen, or go right by holding the right side of the screen. You can collect coins by touching them which will increase your score. Your score is always displayed in the top right corner. Hitting into a monster will cause you to lose the game, and reaching the end of the level will also end the game. Reaching the end of the level will increase your score by 5. Once the game is over you have the chance to enter your name and hit "Submit". Then you are brought back to the main menu.
